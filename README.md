There are a number of things which can be automated in the Gaushala, we will possibly start with an app which would help the Gaushala by sending reminders which would be used for breeding the cows as per schedule.

Detailed requirements to be captured [here](https://github.com/ArtOfLiving-AOL/Gaushala/blob/master/docs/breeding).
